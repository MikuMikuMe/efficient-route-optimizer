# Efficient-Route-Optimizer

Certainly! Below is a basic implementation of the "Efficient Route Optimizer" project. This program utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculation and assumes mock data for traffic, delivery time windows, and vehicle capacities. Note that a real-world implementation would require integration with external APIs or data sources for live traffic data, delivery time constraints, and vehicle capabilities. Error handling and comments are included for clarity.

### Notes:
- **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list. You can modify the `create_mock_graph` function to add more realistic traffic data.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: This is used for finding the shortest path considering cost, which is assumed to be influenced by traffic and distance.
- **Mock Functions**: Functions like `check_delivery_window` and weight validation simulate real-world constraints, serving as placeholders for real data.
- **Error Handling**: Exceptions are caught to handle overloading and no available routes within time windows.
